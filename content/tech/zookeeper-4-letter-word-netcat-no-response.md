# Problem

To report Zookeeper service health, we use the 4 letter word (_4LW_) command
`ruok` and check that response is `imok`.

`netcat` is the channel via which the message is
sent.

After upgrading the operating system from Ubuntu `16.04` to `18.04`, we see that
intermittently there is no response. Hmm...

# Triage

## Is Zookeeper getting those commands?

A simple bash script can be used to verify this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}
do
  status=$(echo "ruok" | nc localhost 2181)
  echo -e "try ${i}: ${status}"
done
```

Output looks suspect:

```bash
root@zk-node:~# ./check_zk.sh
try 1: imok
try 2: imok
try 3: imok
try 4: imok
try 5: imok
try 6:
try 7: imok
try 8:
try 9: imok
try 10: imok
root@zk-node:~#
```

But Zookeeper service has no issues processing the requests:

```bash

No errors or warnings or exceptions. Looks like it is responding just fine. 

## 4LW commands do not work consistently

Next, we tried looking for various causes that result in 4LW commands silently
failing.
Bumped into this known Zookeeper issue
<cite>ZOOKEEPER-737: some 4 letter words may fail with netcat (nc) [^1]</cite>.

Now we did not observe any exceptions in ZK logs - probably because we're
using a later version of ZK - `v3.6.1`. But it does seem like a plausible
root cause.

A <cite>StackOverflow post [^2]</cite> points to the same with a fix to add
delay in netcat before closing the channel.

# Solution

## Add delay to netcat before closing the channel

Based on the <cite>StackOverflow post [^2]</cite>, we added the `-q 1` flag;
which adds a 1 second delay after sending the message and before it closes
the channel.

### Result?

```bash
# status=$(echo "ruok" | nc localhost 2181 -q 1)

root@zk-node:~# ./check_zk.sh
try 1: imok
try 2: imok
try 3: imok
try 4: imok
try 5: imok
try 6: imok
try 7: imok
try 8: imok
try 9: imok
try 10: imok
root@zk-node:~#
```

Consistency at last!

The goal of any platform - it works or it doesn't; either is fine, as long as
it does that consistently.
